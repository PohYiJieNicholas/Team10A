                            During this phase, we discuss and analyse what the customer wanted and the materials provided like the Smartibot Kit.
                            We started by assembling the Smartibot as intended and identify features and design we can use in the new design.
                            We have also discussed with members at team 9 and 10B to know more about their project to find features to add to the design.
